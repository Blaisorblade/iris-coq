 - SCons 2.0
 
BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

First, make sure you checked out all submodules:

  git submodule update --init --recursive

Say "scons" to build the full library, or "scons some_module.vo" to just 
build some_module.vo (and its dependencies).

In addition to common Make options like -j N and -k, SCons supports some 
useful options of its own, such as --debug=time, which displays the time 
spent executing individual build commands.

scons -c replaces Make clean
