PREREQUISITES
-------------

This version is known to compile with:

 - Coq 8.5
 - Ssreflect 1.6

For development, better make sure you have a version of Ssreflect that includes
commit be724937 (no such version has been released so far, you will have to
fetch the development branch yourself). Iris compiles fine even without this
patch, but proof bullets will only be in 'strict' (enforcing) mode with the
fixed version of Ssreflect.
