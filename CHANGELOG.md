In this changelog, we document "large-ish" changes to Iris that affect even the way the logic is used on paper.
We do *not* document changesd of functions names or similar Coq-only API changes.
Changes marked [*] still need to be ported to the Iris Documentation.

## Iris 2.0

[*] Make the core of an RA or CMRA a partial function.

## Iris 2.0-rc1

This is the Coq development and Iris Documentation as submitted to ICFP.
